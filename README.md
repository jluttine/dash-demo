# Plotly Dash demo

A very simple demo of Plotly Dash dashboards and apps. The demo is implemented
as a single "app" that has multiple apps as subpages.

## Installation

Install dependencies, for instance, with pip:

```
pip install dash pandas
```

Or, if you are a nix user, you can use:

```
nix-shell
```

## Usage

Start the Dash demo server:

```
python dash-demo.py
```

An URL is shown. Open that in a browser.

## Documentation

I recommend reading through the Dash documentation: https://dash.plotly.com/

The section "Open Source Component Libraries" lists all the available components
so it is a good section to get an understanding what can be done. You'll
probably find something you didn't even realize to wish.
